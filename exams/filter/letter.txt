Hello everybody out there using minix -
I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby,
won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones.
This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready.
I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix,
as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the
file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things).
I've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things
seem to work. This implies that I'll get something practical
within a few months, and I'd like to know what features most
people would want. Any suggestions are welcome,
but I won't promise I'll implement them :-)

PS. Yes - it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs.
It is NOT portable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it
probably never will support anything other than
AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(
